These are the projects I made when I was learning the basics of Python!

## **Password Manager**:
This is a password manager that allows users to input a list of websites and passwords associated with those websites. User inputs are checked to make sure the user has input only valid information. The user can also have their password scrambled into a random collection of characters and symbols for added security. The user can also de-scramble scrambled passwords and can delete all data inside the password manager.

## **Quiz Game**:
This is a quiz game that asks users trivia questions or math questions. The user can decide whether they want to answer trivia questions first, math questions first, or a mix of both. In each category, the questions are asked in random order. A sound is played whenever the user gets a question right or wrong. At the end of the game, the user is given how many questions they got wrong and how many they got right. Users are also given the option of quitting the game or playing it again.

## **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**:
This is a rock, paper, scissors game in which users go against the computer which makes its decisions through the random library and its functions. Images of rocks, paper, or scissors are shown based on the decision made by the user and the robot. These images are processed by the climage library into printable colored characters which are shown in the Python console. At the end of the game, the user is told the winner of the game or if the game was tied, and the scores of the user and the computer.
