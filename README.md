## **Password Manager**:
This is a password manager that allows users to input a list of websites and passwords associated with those websites. User inputs are checked to make sure the user has input only valid information. The user can also have their password scrambled into a random collection of characters and symbols for added security. The user can also de-scramble scrambled passwords and can delete all data inside the password manager.
